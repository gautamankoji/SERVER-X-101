You as a cricket fan are always involved in this new Mr.360 debate and You want to settle it by comparing the scores gained by the boundaries of Sky and Abd. Print "ABD" OR "SKY" depending upon who scored more from the boundaries.

**Input Format:**

**Output Format:**

* Print SKY or ABD accordingly

**Constraints:**

* 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 10
* 1 ‚â§ A, B, C, D ‚â§ 10000

**Sample Input:**

{{< file "terminal" "Sample Input" >}}

```md
2
8468 6335 6501 9170
5725 1479 9359 6963
```

**Sample Output:**

{{< file "terminal" "Sample Ouput" >}}

```md
ABD
ABD
```

## Solution

<!-- **Approach:** -->

{{< file "python" "count_of_family_members.py" >}}

```py
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sky = l[0]*4 + l[1]*6
    sky = l[2]*4 + l[3]*6
    print("ABD" if abd > sky else "SKY")

```
